\begin{frame}[c]{Context}
    
    %
    \vfill
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ML-based predictors are more and more used in a wide range of fields to perform different tasks
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[e.g.] pattern detection, image and speech recognition, clustering, classification and regression
        \end{itemize}
        
        \vfill
        
        \item predictors hiding their internal logic are named \emph{black boxes}
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[!] black-box predictors cannot give to the user intelligible outputs or \alert{explanations about their outcomes}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \vfill
        
        \item there are critical applications where the output interpretability is not an option
        %
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item for instance healthcare, finance, etc.
        \end{itemize}
    
    	\vfill
        
        \item[$\Rightarrow$] knowledge extraction mechanisms are required to use black-box models in these critical areas 
        
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\begin{frame}[c]{Motivation}
	Several methods were developed to extract knowledge from black-box predictors, however:
    %
    \vfill
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item most of the algorithms existing in the literature focus exclusively on classification tasks, neglecting regression
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[e.g.] \textsc{Trepan}\ccite{Craven1996}, Rule-extraction-as-learning\ccite{craven1994using}, etc.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \vfill
        
        \item most of the knowledge extraction methods applicable to regression black boxes are strongly constrained
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[e.g.] \textsc{RefAnn}\ccite{setiono2002extraction}, only applicable to ANNs with a single hidden layer
        \end{itemize}
        
        \vfill
        
        \item other procedures may suffer of degrading performance when applied to complex problems
        %
        \begin{itemize}
			\item[e.g.] 
			\iter\ccite{huysmans2006iter} as the number of input features grows
		\end{itemize}
        
    \end{itemize}

\frametitle{Conclusions}

\begin{block}{Summing up}
	The new \gridex algorithms is able to:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item overcome the \iter non-exhaustivity
        \item focus only on the interesting regions of the input space
        \item produce shorter rule lists and attain better predictive performances then \iter
    \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Future works}

\begin{exampleblock}{Future works}
	Our next research efforts will address the remaining limitations of \iter and other algorithms, for instance:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the inability to handle categorical features
        \item the constant output value of the produced decision rules 
    \end{itemize}
